# Task 3

## Content of Jupyter Notebook
- preprocessing and analysis of given data
- creating models
  - linear models using scikit-learn
  - neural nets using PyTorch

## How To Run
Everything is in `3.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file. Just run everything

## Results
Linear models didn't bring great results. RMSE equaled around std of target column (28.9). Predicted values were around 50 (mean od target values).
Neural nets brought much better results with RMSE around 0.197. Model was saved in saved_model.pth.


Final results are in internship_hidden_test_target.csv
